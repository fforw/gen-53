# gen-53

Based on gen-52. 

This does the curl-distortion the other way around and smooths out sub-pixel differences for an extra smooth shapes. And 
it applies the former blurmap method to blend the original shapes and the distorted shapes. No actual blurring of the original image
occurs, only a strong blur to smooth out the "blurmap" itself
